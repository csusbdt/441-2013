</ul><h2>Overview</h2>

<p>We meet twice per week.  In addition to the weekly meetings, you can communicate with the class as a whole by posting to the CSUSB CSE 441 Spring 2013 Google Group.  The course is heavily oriented towards programming, and you will need to learn and use C++ and Lua to complete projects in the course.  If you are not sure you are ready for this course, then please discuss with me first.</p>

<p>The course will be oriented towards realtime 2D game programming with an emphasis on developing cross-platform code for desktop and mobile computers.  Students only need to work in one development environment -- either Xcode, Visual Studio, or Linux -- but I will present on development in both Xcode and Visual Studio.</p>

<p>Throughout the course, we will develop a cross-platform approach to building highly performant games targeting Windows and OS X desktop environments.  If someone in the class wants to pursue additional runtime environments -- such as Linux, iOS, Android, Blackberry, NaCl, etc -- then we will include these as well.</p>

<p>You will work in at least 2 languages in this course: C++ and Lua.  Depending on the platform you want to focus on, you may need to work with another language, such as Objective-C for OS X or Java for Android.  You will also need to learn at least the rudiments of low-level graphics programming.</p>

<p>We will use cocos2d-x as a reference project for study and experiments.</p>

<h2>System Requirements</h2>

<p>You can do all required work in this course using any of the three common operating systems: Windows, OS X and Linux.  All required software can be downloaded and installed for free.  You can also use the computers in JB 358, JB 359 and JB 360 to do all required work in this course. The open times for accessing these labs is available from the CSE website or by contacting the CSE main office.</p>

<h2>Google Group</h2>

<ul>
<li>Send me your preferred email. I will use this to invite you to the CSUSB CSE 441 Spring 2013 Google Group.</li>
</ul><h2>Course Goal</h2>

<p>The goal of this course is to increase your understanding of video game programming, programming in general, and cross-platform development for mobile and desktop systems.</p>

<h2>Learning Objectives</h2>

<ul>
<li>Learn how to use Git to manage source code.</li>
<li>Learn how to develop cross-platform video game projects based on C++, Lua, and OpenGL ES 2.0.</li>
</ul><h2>Assignments</h2>

<p>In this course, you will primarily focus on research and experimentation resulting in a collection of small prototypes.  You should strive to make your code as readable as possible.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Is source code well-organized? Have unnecessary variables and logic been removed from the code?  Does the indentation and line spacing show logical structure?  Is indentation and spacing done consistently?  Are concerns separated when possible?  Are the responsibilities of components clear and consistently assigned?  Does the code contain names for variables, functions and classes that unambiguously express their purpose in the program?  Are comments included when needed? Are superfluous comments omitted?  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Program readability is important because real-world programs are read over and over again in the process of fixing bugs and adding new functionality.</p>

<h2>Grading</h2>

<p>I will base your grade on the following criteria.</p>

<pre><code>Grade   Criteria
-----   ---------------------------------------------------------------
  A     Consistent research and experimentation in each week through
        out the quarter.
  B     Provides evidence of reading and experimentation on topics 
        covered by the class.
  C     Provides evidence of reading on topics covered by the course
        but with inadequate experimentation.
  D     Shows up to class but does not provide evidence of any effort
        beyond this.
  F     Absent from class and no evidence of reading and experimentation.
</code></pre>

<h2>Students with Disabilities</h2>

<p>If you are in need of an accommodation for a disability in order to participate in this class, please let me know as soon as possible, and also contact Services to Students with Disabilities at UH-183, (909) 537-5238.  You are advised to establish a buddy system and alternate in the class if you require assistance in the event of an emergency. Individuals with disabilities should prepare for an emergency ahead of time by instructing a classmate and the instructor.
Academic Regulations and Procedures</p>

<p>See the CSUSB Bulletin of Courses for the University's policies on course withdrawal, cheating, and plagiarism.</p>

<h2>Computer Science and Engineering Club</h2>

<p>The Computer Science and Engineering Club is a student-run organization that uses a combination of email and campus meetings to plan events, ask and answer technical questions, post job and internship openings, and discuss other topics of interest to computing majors at CSUSB. Club-sponsored events include seminars, workshops, tutoring and fun activities.</p>
